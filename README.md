# Bag Engine [Working on the 0.2 version]
üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Warning: This project is not yet production-ready. The source code contains many bugs, but development continues after a one-year break! <br><br>
Bag Engine is a 2D game engine built with Java and OpenGL, utilizing industry-standard libraries such as ImGui, Box2D, and GSON. While the engine is not yet production-ready, you can check the milestones section for a better understanding of its current state.

# Documentation

# Libraries/Technologies:
- Maven: Build System
- LWJGL: For window handling, graphics and math libraries.
- Box2D: For Physics
- GSON: For serialization/deserialization
- ImGUI: For UI elements

# Functionalities:
## Editor and Runtime 
Bag Engine includes an integrated editor that allows users to create and modify their own levels, with a built-in serializer handling the saving process. By pressing the 'Play' button, users can launch a debug mode, which effectively serves as the engine's runtime. <br><br><br>

## ECS System
The engine features a classic Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. This allows each scene to contain multiple game objects, each composed of various components. These components define and modify the behavior of their respective game objects. <br><br><br>

## Physics System
The engine includes a physics system powered by the Box2D library. This enables the creation of dynamic game objects that move based on real-world physics simulations. <br><br><br>

## Docking 
With the help of the industry-recognized and widely used ImGui library, I am able to provide a highly dynamic user interface. As a result, all GUI elements are fully customizable and can be tailored to the user's specific needs. <br><br><br>

## Asset Browser
The engine features an Asset Browser, which allows users to browse through tiles, prefabs, and audio files. <br><br><br>
