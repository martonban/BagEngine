# Bag Engine [Working on the 0.2 version]
Bag Engine is a 2D game engine in Java and OpenGL. This is currently a tutorial based project ([this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyKE7vz65rY&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE)). But I am going to work on this engine after a year. Curretly I am going to work on some critical bugs I have to fix, before implementing some new features.

# Functionalities:
## Editor and Runtime
