# Bag Engine
This is my first 2D ECS Game Engine based on LWJGL. The main purpose of this project it is going to be my BSC thesis.

# Development's Journey
In the beginning I started this project as just tutorial following, to understand the basics of OpenGL and Game Engine development in Java. The main reason I used Java beacuse in my univesity we dosen't have C++ course. I had a course where I have to do my thesis preperation. I spoked with my consultant and showed him GamesWithGabe's Mario Engine dvelopment course. He suggested me to go throw some videos and if I like it I need to finish it.
